# Weather App

## Basic Idea

Within starting window user have an options

- Enter a city inside input field
- Press a button to get location 

Those two make same result - user gets current weather, 24 hours forecast and weekly forecast. After closing page or refreshing it forecast will remain, but if it's needed - there's button to get back to starting page. 

## Thing I needed outside the tech stack

- Weather API: 
- SwiperJS: 

## Things that i've made that was pretty interesting and challenging

- Used GeolocationAPI to get user's location
- Async/await for asynchronous code
- try/catch, then/catch/finally to work w/ errors
- Requests made w/ Fetch
- SwiperJS to make a sliders
- Styles and adaptiveness via SCSS
- localStorage to keep user data

Also project made w/ Webpack.
